<h2 data-header-item="about">hi, I'm Jane!</h2>

<h4 class="text-center">I’d love to help you use what’s already in your closet and shop more responsibly, sustainably and economically.</h4>

<p>When I came to New York for college almost 20 years ago, I volunteered at a local <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/" target="_blank">Housing Works</a> thrift shop, and became obsessed with the beautiful, high-quality clothing that people donated. I have been shopping secondhand ever since.</p>

<p>While it was a financial necessity at first, thrifting has now become a passion project. I made the personal choice to opt out of fast fashion 5 years ago. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clothing production has doubled since 2000. While people bought 60% more clothing, they kept it for half as long.</li>
<li>The fashion industry is the second largest world-wide consumer of water and is responsible for 20% of the world’s water pollution. Although synthetic fibers like polyester have less impact on land and water, they have almost double the carbon footprint of cotton.</li>
<li>The clothing and footwear industries cause 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (more emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined!) and are expected to increase to 49% of all greenhouse emissions by 2030.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I shared my thrifting finds with friends and colleagues, they started asking me to style them; I became the de-facto person to help with closet organization and personal shopping. I’ve shopped for people sizes 0-22, in person and virtually.</p>

<p id="services">Since I’ve spent hundreds of hours in thrift stores, my process is both intuitive and intentional. My style is guided by that of my clients, with a fresh eye for quality and proportion.</p>

<h3>how I style</h3>

<p><em>I am 100% upcycled:</em> I believe the most sustainable way shop is to buy secondhand. I have many talented colleagues who work with brands that don’t pollute the earth or produce human suffering, and that’s great. But I have clients who don’t see the items they like to wear from companies they want to buy from, and even more clients for whom the prices of ethical brands are not accessible. Moreover, I know that <a href="https://scienceline.org/2018/06/the-troubled-second-life-of-donated-clothes/" target="blank">over 80% of donated clothes currently go to landfills</a>, and I want to do something to address this issue.</p>

<p><em>I save my clients money:</em> My clients feel great not because they are giving clothes a new life and contributing to the circular economy, but also because they are getting things they would not be able to afford otherwise at a fraction of the cost of retail. In many cases, the money my clients save more than pays for my fees.</p>

<p><em>I am body neutral:</em> The crux of body neutrality is focusing on what your body does, rather than how the body looks. I don’t care what your body looks like. I believe that all bodies are good bodies, that you should dress for the body you have in clothes that are comfortable and make you feel good. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-body-neutrality_n_5b61d8f9e4b0de86f49d31b4" target="_blank">This Huffpost article</a> breaks down why body neutrality is better for mental health than body positivity.</p>

<blockquote>Body neutrality is about seeing your body as a vehicle that, when treated with care, can help you move about the world in a way that brings you joy. That’s it. No thinking about how you look, either good or bad.</blockquote>

<p>As a mom, I am especially conscious of not criticizing my own body, because that is not the example I want to give to my daughter.  Instead, I try to practice gratitude; I am grateful for the arms that allow me to hold my daughter, and for the legs that carry me where I need to go.</p>

<p>I won’t tell you what looks good on someone with your figure, or that you need to get to your “goal weight” before investing in new clothes, because I think that’s all bullshit. Moreover, I believe that fashion is an arbitrary set of rules designed to fuel consumption, so I won’t be talking about what is “in style” or “age appropriate” either.  If there are parts of your body you love, I will work with you to accentuate them. If you want to camouflage a part of your body, I will help you as well, but I’ll also try to change the conversation to dig deeper into your perceptions and attitudes.</p>

<h3>closet edit: re-love your closet</h3>

<p>Before booking a shopping trip, I recommend recommend starting with the Re-love Your Closet service.</p>

<p>The Re-Love Your Closet process includes an initial conversation, where I get some key information including your:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifestyle (where you wear your clothes)</li>
<li>Goals for closet consultation</li>
<li>Current style (how you wear your clothes, what makes you feel great)</li>
</ul>

<p>We then go through your closet together piece by piece. I will help you decide whether it makes sense to keep an item, reinvent it, or whether it no longer serves your lifestyle. After our session, you will receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>a “style profile” assessment to help guide future shopping</li>
<li>photos from the looks we created</li>
<li>a list of items that will augment your current wardrobe</li>
</ul>

<p>Time: 3-5 hours (exact time depends on the size of your closet)
Rate: $75/hour</p>

<h3>sustainable shopping (nyc)</h3>

<p>While I recommend doing the closet edit prior to shopping, some of my clients prefer to dive right in! I’ll arrive at the store about an hour before you to pre-select items.</p>

<p>I will choose things that go with your style and can be combined with items that you already own, but I’ll also take you out of your comfort zone a bit, whether it be with color, pattern or shape.</p>

<p>As you try on each piece, I’ll be there to help each step of the way. We will discuss how the items work together and fit your lifestyle, how to style things seasonally, and how to achieve the style you want with certain items of clothing.</p>

<p>The process is collaborative and fun, and you will leave with pieces that you love and will want to wear!</p>

<p>After our session, you will receive a photo “look book” of the outfits you tried on and suggestions of how to wear your new pieces.</p>

<p>Time: 4 hours<br/>
Rate: $75/hour</p>

<h3>virtual styling</h3>

<p>Not in NYC area? No worries! Whether you are looking for seasonal items, a specific piece, clothes for an upcoming vacation, or a killer special occasion outfit, I can take the stress out of the sourcing process!</p>

<p>Time: This will vary based on your need, but my goal is always for the cost of my services plus the clothing you buy to come in under retail.<br/>

<h3>How do I prepare?</h3>

<p>Think about the goals you have for working with me: How do you want to update your look? What are the challenges you have when getting dressed in the morning? Are there specific occasions where you find yourself struggling with what to wear?</p>

<p>In my sessions, I always ask my clients about their go-to outfits, so think about what you currently like to wear, or find yourself frequently gravitating to. Look through your wardrobe with an eye for pieces you love, but don’t wear as often as you’d like.</p> 

<p>It’s definitely helpful if you start to purge the things you don’t want or don’t like. If you're unsure, then you can put your to-be-donated clothes aside and we can look through them during our session. If the idea of solo closet organizing makes you nervous, don’t worry—we can do it together!</p>

<h3>What do I wear to our shopping session?</h3>

<p>Please wear a black or cream tank top and black leggings. Fitting rooms have a 3 item limit and a one-person per room rule, so trying items over clothes is far more efficient.</p>

<p>Also, please bring reusable bags if you have them, as well as a bottle of water.</p>

<h3>How much should I expect to spend?</h3>

<p>Most of my clients spend between $150 and $300. Non-designer items are about $10 a piece, while boutique items start at about $20. My clients save anywhere from 40% to 90% when compared to retail!</p>
