<h2 data-header-item="about">About</h2>

Mission Managed helps clients develop and meet their their social impact goals, build their supporter base and increase operational efficiency.

<h4>Founder: Jane Kogan, LMSW</h4>

I've been passionate about servant leadership for as long as I can remember. In college I planned to practice therapy, but I quickly realized that my strengths lay in working on an organizational level.

I studied social enterprise administration at Columbia University. Since then, Iâ€™ve had over 10 years of capacity-building experience helping organizations engage volunteers, supporters and donors, develop innovative programs, and build strategic partnerships.
 
When I am not helping organizations be their best selves, you can find me chasing my 18-month-old daughter, treasure hunting for designer bargains at NYC thrift stores and wanderlusting about our next family adventure.
