<h2 data-header-item="about">Hi, I’m Jane!</h2>

<h4 class="text-center">I’d love to help you use what’s already in your closet and shop more responsibly, sustainably and economically.</h4>

When I came to New York for college almost 20 years ago, I volunteered at a local [Housing Works](https://www.housingworks.org/) thrift shop, and became obsessed with the beautiful, high-quality clothing that people donated. I have been shopping secondhand ever since.

I found a niche for myself thrifting luxury clothing and consigning it with companies like [the Real Real](https://www.therealreal.com/). In the last three years, I have consigned over 1000 items while working full-time in the social impact sector (my professional background is in social work administration).

While it was a financial necessity at first, thrifting has now become a passion project. I made the personal choice to opt out of fast fashion 5 years ago. Here's why:
* Clothing production has doubled since 2000. While people bought 60% more clothing, they kept it for half as long. 
* The fashion industry is the second largest world-wide consumer of water and is responsible for 20% of the world’s water pollution. Although synthetic fibers like polyester have less impact on land and water, they have almost double the carbon footprint of cotton.
* The clothing and footwear industries cause 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (more emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined!) and are expected to increase to 49% of all greenhouse emissions by 2030.

When I shared my thrifting finds with friends and colleagues, they started asking me to style them; I became the de-facto person to help with closet organization and personal shopping. I’ve shopped for people sizes 0-22, in person and virtually. During this process I realized how much I enjoy styling others.  

Since I’ve spent hundreds of hours in thrift stores, my process is both intuitive and intentional. My style is guided by that of my clients, with a fresh eye for quality and proportion.

<h3>Closet Edit: Re-love Your Closet (NYC/Virtual)</h3>

Before booking a shopping trip, I recommend recommend starting with the Re-love Your Closet service. The best clothes are those you already own, and yet, most of us wear 20% of our clothing 80% of the time! Let me help you find treasures in your closet and help you identify gaps. 

The Re-Love Your Closet process includes an initial conversation, where I get some key information including your:
* Lifestyle (where you wear your clothes)
* Goals for closet consultation (why you are coming to me and what you hope to accomplish)
* Current style (how you wear your clothes, what makes you feel great)

We then go through your closet together piece by piece. I will help you decide whether it makes sense to keep an item, reinvent it, or whether it no longer serves your lifestyle. 

During this process, I will take stock of what you have, which will help identify common themes, as well as wardrobe gaps. 

Once we’ve organized your closet, it’s time to shop from what you have and identify new ways to style your current clothing! We will create outfit combinations and I will take photos to help keep track of what we are doing. 

After our session, you will receive:
* a “style profile” assessment to help guide future shopping
* photos from the looks we created 
* a list of items that will augment your current wardrobe

Time: 3-5 hours (note: this can vary based upon the size of your closet)
Rate: $75/hour

<h3>Sustainable Shopping (NYC)</h3>

While I recommend doing the closet edit prior to shopping, some of my clients prefer to dive right in! I’ll arrive at the store about an hour before you to pre-select items.

I will choose things that go with your style and can be combined with items that you already own, but I’ll also take you out of your comfort zone a bit, whether it be with color, pattern or shape.  

As you try on each piece, I’ll be there to help each step of the way. We will discuss how the items work together and fit your lifestyle, how to style things seasonally, and how to achieve the style you want with certain items of clothing.

The process is collaborative and fun, and you will leave with pieces that you love and will want to wear! 

After our session, you will receive a photo “look book” of the outfits you tried on and suggestions of how to wear your new pieces. 

Time: 4 hours<br/>

Not in NYC area? No worries! Whether you are looking for seasonal items, a specific piece, clothes for an upcoming vacation, or a killer special occasion outfit, I can take the stress out of the sourcing process! 

Time: This will vary based on your need, but my goal is always for the cost of my services plus the clothing you buy to come in under retail.

<h2 data-header-item="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<h3>How do I prepare for the Closet Edit?</h3>

Think about the goals you have for working with me: How do you want to update your look? What are the challenges you have when getting dressed in the morning? Are there specific occasions where you find yourself struggling with what to wear?

In my sessions, I always ask my clients about their go-to outfits, so think about what you currently like to wear, or find yourself frequently gravitating to. Look through your wardrobe with an eye for pieces you love, but don’t wear as often as you’d like. 

It’s definitely helpful if you start to purge the things you don’t want or don’t like. If you're unsure, then you can put your to-be-donated clothes aside and we can look through them during our session. If the idea of solo closet organizing makes you nervous, don’t worry—we can do it together!

<h3>What do I wear to our shopping session?</h3>

Please wear a black or cream tank top and black leggings. Fitting rooms have a 3 item limit and a one-person per room rule, so trying items over clothes is far more efficient. 
Also, please bring reusable bags if you have them, as well as a bottle of water. 

<h3>How much should I expect to spend?</h3>

Most of my clients spend between $150 and $300. Non-designer items are about $10 a piece, while boutique items start at about $20. My clients save anywhere from 40% to 90% when compared to retail!

<h3>Have additional questions?</h3>

I want to answer them!
