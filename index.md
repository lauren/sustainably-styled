<h4 class="text-center">Are you looking for someone who can help you discover, or rediscover your style in a way that is strategic, sustainable, and affordable?</h4>

<p>Your wardrobe reflects your personality, lifestyle and values to others. What you wear impacts how you think, feel and behave and allows you to shape the narrative of how others perceive you. The things you wear every day should be comfortable, make you feel confident and align with the image you want to project.</p>

<p>With Sustainably Styled, you will rediscover the gems in your closet and build an affordable, cohesive wardrobe with quality, second-hand items. You will also save as much as 40% - 90% on clothing when compared to retail!</p>

<p>Sustainably Styled helps you to:</p>

<li>Make sense of your closet and put outfits together.</li>
<li>Take the dread factor out of clothes shopping.</li>

</ul>

<p>Style has nothing to do with the shape and size of your body. You deserve clothes that are comfortable and make you feel good. Let’s work together to dress the body you have affordably and sustainably, in a way that feels authentic and comfortable.</p>

<p id="services">You are the expert on your life and have your own style sensibilities, whether or not you can describe them to me.  You will tell me how you want to appear to the world, what style you would like to emulate, how you would like to feel in your clothes, and the emotions that you want your style to evoke. We will discover this together.</p>

<p>You will gain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clarity about what you like to wear</li>
<li>Insight about making new combinations from your current closet</li>
<li>Excitement about being a part of the circular fashion movement</li>
</ul>

<p>Your styling journey will begin with a conversation about your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifestyle (where you wear your clothes)</li>

<li>Current style (how you wear your clothes, what makes you feel great)</li>
</ul>

<h3>closet strategy session</h3>

<p>I recommend that you start your sustainable style journey in your own closet.</p>

<p>The Re-Love Your Closet process includes an initial conversation, where I get some key information including your:</p>

<p>We will go through your closet together piece by piece. I will help you decide what it makes sense to keep, reinvent or donate/consign/recycle. After our session, you will receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>a “style profile” assessment to help guide future shopping</li>
<li>photos from the looks we created</li>
<li>a list of items that will augment your current wardrobe</li>
</ul>

<p>Time: 2.5-5 hours (exact time depends on the size of your closet)
Rate: $75/hour</p>

<h3>sustainable shopping (nyc)</h3>

<p>While I recommend doing the closet strategy session prior to shopping, you may prefer to dive right in! The process is always collaborative and should be fun; you will leave with quality pieces that you love and will want to wear!</p>

<p>In our first conversation, we will decide where we will go shopping. We will choose a specific second-hand store from a list that I will provide, then I will spend an hour there before you arrive to pre-select items. I will pull things that go with your style and can be combined with items that you already own. We may experiment and look at things that are a bit out of your comfort zone for some variety in your wardrobe.</p>

<p>As you try on each piece, I’ll be there to help every step of the way. We will discuss how the items work together, how to style things seasonally, and how to combine items to achieve the look you want. If you don’t find items that you like (which rarely happens), we can travel to another store together.</p>

<p>After our session, you will receive a photo “look book” of the outfits you tried on and suggestions of how to wear your new pieces.</p>

<p>Time: 4 hours<br/>
Rate: $75/hour</p>

<h3>virtual styling</h3>

<p>Not in NYC area? No worries! Whether you are looking for seasonal items, a specific piece, clothes for an upcoming vacation, or a killer special occasion outfit, I can take the stress out of the sourcing process!</p>

<p>Time: This will vary based upon your need. In many cases, the money you will save by shopping smart and second-hand with Sustainably Styled will cover your investment.<br/>

<p>She's filled my closet with an outrageous amount of designer clothing (purchased at Goodwill prices!) that fit well, make me feel comfortable and confident, and get tons of compliments. I love buying clothes second-hand to reduce my bills, my impact on the environment, and my stress about whether or not I'll "really love" a piece of clothing.<br/>
&mdash;Lauren</p>

<p>Working with Jane is amazing. She's able to sort through the retail clutter to find high quality second hand pieces in pristine condition. She brings a rare enthusiasm towards unearthing treasures at second hand stores, and matching the right clothing finds with the right person.<br/> 
&mdash;Alisha</p>

<p>Jane has the patience, intuition, attentiveness, and style-sense of a fashion saint (if that's a thing)! On too many occasions to count, she has rummaged through racks that overwhelm me at first glance whipping out gems in what seems like lightning speed.<br/>

<h2 data-header-item="jane">about me</h2>

<img src="/images/jane2.jpg" alt="Jane Kogan, Sustainably Styled founder"/>

<p>Hi! I’m Jane, and I’d love to help you use what’s already in your closet and shop more responsibly, sustainably and economically. When I came to New York for college on a student budget almost 20 years ago, I volunteered at a local <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works</a> thrift shop, and became obsessed with the beautiful, high-quality clothing that people donated. I had very little money to spare, but found that my dollars went a lot further by shopping secondhand. I continued to shop secondhand when I was earning my Master’s Degree in social work administration at Columbia University, and when I worked in rare disease advocacy and association management. In each step of my personal and professional life, I was able to find awesome, appropriate clothing on a shoestring budget.</p>

<p>I have a lot of contemporary designer brands like Diane Von Furstenberg, Equipment, Milly and Kate Spade.</p>

<p>When I shared my thrifting finds with friends and colleagues, they started asking me to style them; I became the de-facto person to help with closet organization and personal shopping. I’ve shopped for people sizes 0-22, in person and found myself enjoying using my social work skills in a different way, helping people of all sizes and shapes feel great about themselves.</p>

<p>Now, I am a mom living in the NYC area with my husband and young daughter. I shop second-hand for my entire family. As a mom, I am especially conscious of not criticizing the body, because that is not the example I want to give to my daughter.</p>

<p>I’ve spent hundreds of hours in thrift stores, so my shopping process is both intuitive and intentional. My style is guided by that of my clients, with a fresh eye for quality and proportion.</p>

<h2 data-header-item="ethics">the ethics of buying second-hand</h2>

<p>I believe in the adage that "Every dollar you spend… or don’t spend is a vote you cast for the world you want." A United Nations report called fashion "<a href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/meetings/2018/20180716/UN_Partnership_on_Sustainable_Fashion_programme_as_of_6-7-2018.pdf">an environmental and social emergency</a>." Here are a few reasons why the fashion industry, particularly fast fashion, is problematic:</p>

<ul>
<li>People don’t wear the clothes they have. In the US, each person throws away an average of 70 pounds of clothing per year. Collectively, we miss out on $460 billion dollars in value by getting rid of clothes that we could continue to wear [<a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/fashion-and-the-circular-economy">learn more</a>]</li>
<li>The fashion industry is rife with labor abuses, primarily of women and children. [<a href="https://truecostmovie.com/learn-more/human-rights/">learn more</a>]</li>  
<li>The fashion industry is terrible for the planet. It is responsible for 20% of the world’s water pollution, 25% of the world’s chemical use and has more emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined [<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10#some-apparel-companies-are-starting-to-buck-these-trends-by-joining-initiatives-to-cut-back-on-textile-pollution-and-grow-cotton-more-sustainably-in-march-the-un-launched-the-alliance-for-sustainable-fashion-which-will-coordinate-efforts-across-agencies-to-make-the-industry-less-harmful-22">learn more</a>]</li>

<p>I do my best to only shop ethical brands; check out the <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/about/">Good on You</a> website, which rates companies according to their treatment of people (their workers), animals, and the planet. Yet ethically-made clothes are justifiably more expensive. I prefer to spend my money on used clothes. Over 80% of donated clothes currently go to landfills, and I want to do something to address this issue.</p>

<p>Let’s work together to wear more of the things you already own, and renew your wardrobe!</p>

<h2 data-header-item="faqs">faq</h2>

<h3>How do I prepare for the Closet Strategy Session?</h3>

<p>Think about the goals you have for working with me: How do you want to update your look? What are the challenges you have when getting dressed in the morning? Are there specific occasions where you find yourself struggling with what to wear?</p>

<p>In my sessions, I always ask my clients about their go-to outfits, so think about what you currently like to wear, or find yourself frequently gravitating to. Look through your wardrobe with an eye for pieces you love, but don’t wear as often as you’d like.</p> 

<p>It’s definitely helpful if you start to purge the things you don’t want or don’t like. If you're unsure, then you can put your to-be-donated clothes aside and we can look through them during our session. If the idea of solo closet organizing makes you nervous, don’t worry&mdash;we can do it together!</p>

<h3>What do I wear to our shopping session?</h3>

<p>Please wear a black or cream tank top and black leggings. Fitting rooms have a 3 item limit and a one-person per room rule, so trying items over clothes is far more efficient.</p>

<p>Also, please bring reusable bags if you have them, as well as a bottle of water.</p>

<h3>How much should I expect to spend?</h3>

<p>We will work within your budget. At Goodwill, non-designer items are about $10 each, whereas boutique items start at about $20. My clients save anywhere from 40% to 90% when compared to retail!</p>

<h3>How long is an average session?</h3>

<p>The closet strategy session depends on the size of your closet and usually ranges from 2.5 to 5 hours. The sustainable shopping session is 4 hours.</p>

<h3>What is circular fashion, anyway?</h3>

<p>According to Harper’s Bazaar, circular fashion is an off-shoot of the circular economy concept (an economic system aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources) that reimagines fashion’s linear production line that ends with clothes being discarded in landfill [<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a27189370/circular-fashion-definition/">read more</a>].</p>

<h3>What can I expect to find?</h3>

<p>Part of the fun of shopping secondhand is the surprise; you never know what you might find, and you’ll never see the same thing. We might strike gold. Here are a few of my favorite finds from over the years:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.therealreal.com/products/men/clothing/sweatshirts-and-hoodies/givenchy-2016-tonal-jesus-sweatshirt-1">Givenchy sweatshirt</a> for $19.99 (I actually found three of them)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/jackets/moncler-perforated-lightweight-jacket-6nif6">Moncler jacket</a> for 14.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/calvin-klein-collection-silk-grosgrain-trimmed-dress-w-slash-tags">Calvin Klein Collection dress</a> with tags for 59.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/knitwear/celine-cashmere-turtleneck-sweater-7atve">Celine cashmere turtleneck sweater</a> for 7.99</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't promise you that you will find designer items that you like in your size...but I often do. Here is <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sustainably-styled-jersey-city-3?hrid=ymg3yJEn7qc5hyd-1ZLWhg">a review from my client Lauren</a>, with photos of some of the designer dresses I’ve found for her, most of which cost $30 dollars or less!</p>

<h3>How worn are the items?</h3>

<p>It depends. Some are new with tags, others have noticeable wear such as pills or stains. Generally, stores don’t put out items with significant damage, but they don’t catch everything, so I always examine items with clients before they make a purchase. Online sellers usually describe the condition of the item, and most reseller sites, like ThredUp, Tradesy and Poshmark, allow free returns of items that don’t match the seller’s description.</p>

<h3>Can I return the items I purchase?</h3>

<p>In some cases, yes. For example, Goodwill allows you to return items for credit within 5 days and ThredUp allows you to return items for a $1.99 restocking fee.</p>
